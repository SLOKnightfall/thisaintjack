To use this web-app, please follow these steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="/user/newlogin">Create an account</a>. Please only create one account per every camp-site. See the FAQ below
for details. Please update your profile to tell us about yourself and how we can get a hold of you.
</li>
<li><a href="/campsite/0">Register a camp-site</a>. Give your camp-site some descriptive name so we can figure who
is who.</li>
<li>In your new camp-site, register big-shit (art, free standind shade structures, etc -- see FAQ below) that will be associated
with your camp-site.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h4>FAQ</h4>
<br/>

<div class="box">
<ul>
<li>Who should create an account? One person per camp-site should create an account and tell us about your camp-site. If
you have two vehicles travelling together to make one camp-site, elect one person to create an account and tell us
about your site.</li>
<li>If something changes, should I come back here? Yes! Please keep your profil, camp-site and big-shit up to date.</li>
<li>I can't come to burning man! How do I take myself out of this thing? Edit your camp-site and update the right number of people. If the entire camp-site won't be in Orbitals (or even at the burn), set the people attening to 0. I'm bummed you won't be there!</li>
<li>Why the fuck are we doing this? We've created this web-app to take the pain out of planning the camp. If everyone
can take a litle bit of time to tell us about your camp-sites we can make it easier for everyone. The camp organizers
can then take this information and tell Burning Man about our space needs. Also, we have all the information gathered
in one central location so we can place peopl in camp before we arrive on the playa.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Glossary</h4>
<br/>

<div class="box">
<ul>
<li><b>Camp site</b>: An area where you, people traveling with you and your vehicle will be. Unless your vehicle is an
RV, you do not need to tell us about your vehicle.</li>
<li><b>Big shit</b>: Anything beyond your camp-site that will take up space in camp. Please include free standing shade
structures, RVs, showers, art displays and the like. Do not include shade structures attached to your vehicle, unless they're
bigger than 10'x10'.</li>
<li><b>Burner</b>: That's you!</a></li>
<li><b>Jack</b>: The superhuman canadian mad scientist. And this web app ain't him!</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Math</h4>
<br/>

<div class="box">
<ul>
Through the years we found that the number of happy campers = space assigned in square feet / 500.<br/>
<br/>
At that density, zero planning is needed. People organize themselves spontaneously on site.<br/>
<br/>
In general, person + their vehicle footprint + their shit = 400 sq ft, which leaves 100 sq ft / person for community space -- bar, public areas, spaces between personal stuff where people walk etc.<br/>
<br/>

It's possible to pack people far more densely than that, but it usually starts to take actual work and planning.<br/>
So at the beginning, it's just useful to do the simple math total no. people x 400 sq ft + total area of big shit (shade) should be less than total area assigned or more serious planning will probably be needed.

</ul>
